" Abstract-Ship detection is of great importance and full of challenges in the field of remote sensing. The complexity of application scenarios, the redundancy of detection region, and the difficulty of dense ship detection are all the main obstacles that limit the successful operation of traditional methods in ship detection. In this paper, we propose a brand new detection model based on multiscale rotational region convolutional neural network to solve the problems above. This model is mainly consist of five consecutive parts: Dense Feature Pyramid Network (DFPN), adaptive region of interest (ROI) Align, rotational bounding box regression, prow direction prediction and rotational nonmaximum suppression (R-NMS). First of all, the low-level location information and high-level semantic information are fully utilized through multiscale feature networks. Then, we design adaptive ROI Align to obtain high quality proposals which remain complete spatial and semantic information. Unlike most previous approaches, the prediction obtained by our method is the minimum bounding rectangle of the object with less redundant regions. Therefore, rotational region detection framework is more suitable to detect the dense object than traditional detection model. Additionally, we can find the berthing and sailing direction of ship through prediction. A detailed evaluation based on SRSS and DOTA dataset for rotation detection shows that our detection method has a competitive performance",1806.04828,cs.CV,1,2,2018-06-13 02:48:44+00:00,,True,True,12.0,,1446.0,,,55.0,,0.0,,13.0,,

"The C-V2X or LTE-V standard has been designed to support V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communications. The standard is an evolution of LTE, and it has been published by the 3GPP in Release 14. This new standard introduces the C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4 that is specifically designed for V2V communications. In Mode 4, vehicles autonomously select and manage their radio resources without any cellular infrastructure support. Mode 4 is highly relevant since V2V safety applications cannot depend on the availability of infrastructure-based cellular coverage. This paper presents a set of novel analytical models of the communication performance of C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4. In particular, the paper presents analytical models for the average PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) as a function of the distance between transmitter and receiver, and for the four different types of transmission errors that can be encountered in C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4. The models are validated in this study for a wide range of transmission parameters and traffic densities. To this aim, this study compares the results obtained with the analytical models to those obtained with a C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4 simulator implemented by the authors over the Veins simulation platform.

3DPIFCM Novel Algorithm for Segmentation of Noisy Brain MRI Images,2002.01985,cs.CV cs.DC eess.IV,1,2,2020-02-05 20:48:51+00:00,,True,True,45.0,,1809.0,,,34.0,,0.0,,30.0,,
"Abstract-We present a novel algorithm named 3DPIFCM, for automatic segmentation of noisy MRI Brain images. The algorithm is an extension of a well-known IFCM (Improved Fuzzy C-Means) algorithm. It performs fuzzy segmentation and introduces a fitness function that is affected by proximity of the voxels and by the color intensity in 3D images. The 3DPIFCM algorithm uses PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) in order to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the 3DPIFCM uses 3D features of near voxels to better adjust the noisy artifacts. In our experiments, we evaluate 3DPIFCM on T1 Brainweb dataset with noise levels ranging from 1% to 20% and on a synthetic dataset with ground truth both in 3D. The analysis of the segmentation results shows a significant improvement in the segmentation quality of up to 28% compared to two generic variants in noisy images and up to 60% when compared to the original FCM (Fuzzy C-Means)",2002.01985,cs.CV cs.DC eess.IV,2,2,2020-02-10 19:22:59+00:00,4 days 22:34:08,True,True,16.0,-29.0,1440.0,417.0,48.0,20.0,-14.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,-9.0,True

"Abstract-Power systems are undergoing a transformation toward a low-carbon non-synchronous generation portfolio. A major concern for system planners and operators is the system dynamics in the high renewable penetration future. Because of the scale of the system and numerous components involved, it is extremely difficult to develop high PV dynamic models based upon actual power system models. The main contribution of this paper is providing an example of developing high PV penetration models based on the validated dynamic model of an actual large-scale power gridthe U.S. Eastern Interconnection system. The displacement of conventional generators by PV is realized by optimization. Combining the PV distribution optimization and the validated dynamic model information, this approach avoids the uncertainties brought about by transmission planning. As the existing dynamic models can be validated by measurements, this approach improves the credibility of the high PV models in representing future power grids. This generic approach can be applied to develop high PV dynamic models for other actual largescale systems",2010.11150,eess.SY cs.SY,3,3,2022-01-29 15:35:44+00:00,456 days 22:52:01,True,True,8.0,-1.0,992.0,131.0,0.0,27.0,-37.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,-2.0,True
